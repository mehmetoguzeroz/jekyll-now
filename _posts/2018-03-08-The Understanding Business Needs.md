title: Understanding the Business Needs
---

In the beginning of workday, My manager calls me for explaning the new project which will be assigned on me. All you know, conversation can be nervous with manager and it continues with inner-speakings. However; there is a suprise for me. This new assignment is related to understand business needs and problems. My manager realized at the last conference this issue and decide to create a project for this. My manager was citing "we need to focus on business with all aspects, even the perspective they don't have" from conference.


I was totally independent at this project; however there is only advice from my colleagues for starting point.
